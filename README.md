#Anomaly detection

This is based on the kaggle competition "[Anomaly Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/anomaly-detection/overview)"


##Overview
Let us assume that, we have a company called "Splash", and you are a newly joined Machine Learning Engineer at our company, held at 30 LPA CTC. So, the below thing describes our company and the task in hand.

Currently we at Splash, help retailers with pricing intelligence and business monitoring.

One of our main challenges comprise of monitoring and analyzing our client's business metrics in real time for instant detection of the incidents that may impact their revenue.

One subpart of this challenge is Anomaly Detection which generates alerts on our client's business metrics.

The Problem Statement presented below highlights the problem which we are tackling right now

##Column Description

The description of the column are as follows:

timestamp [ float ] : is provided as a Unix epoch in seconds.

value [ int ] : is a real value measurement of some metric at the timestamp.

is_anomaly [ boolean ] : is a boolean value which is True if the corresponding value is identified as an anomaly.

predicted [ float ] : is a real value prediction coming from a black box forecasting model for that timestamp. This black box forecasting model is assumed to be aware of only the true data distribution.

Since the company is concerned about the anomaly data more than non-anomaly data, we have to be careful in making the predictions for the anomaly cases. Here we have used different ML models to compare their performances in determining the anomaly cases.
